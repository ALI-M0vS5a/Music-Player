# MediaPlayer2
Remake of my old MediaPlayer 

Simple Music Player `100% Made in Kotlin` with Jetpack Compose & AndroidX Media3.

- Development Status :
> - Currently this App has no screen UI developed whatsoever since I still need to play around a bit. But its possible to chose Audio from File Manager & Google Drive and control it through Media Notification, this app does not ask for storage permission so you need to grant it yourself if you want It to scan and build the default playlist instead of single song playing.
>  - Still undecided about Architecture but might go with Reactive Style MVVM.
> - Android Nougat 7.0 / API 24 and above.
