# MediaPlayer2
Remake of my old MediaPlayer with Jetpack Compose & Coil & AndroidX Media3

Simple Music Player `100% Made in Kotlin`.

> Currently this App has no Screen UI developed whatsoever since I still need to play around a bit.
> But its possible to chose Audio from File Manager & Google Drive, this app doesn't ask for storage permission so you need to enable it yourself if you want It to scan and build the default playlist instead of single song playing.

Nothing Here
